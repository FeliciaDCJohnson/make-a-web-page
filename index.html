    <div> Lesson 1 </b>     
<br>I learned the major pieces of the web; Me, my computer running a browser, the Internet, and Servers. <br>
We learned that the language used to communicate with the computer is called <b>Hypertext Markup language. </b> <br>
It is made up of text content (what you see), markings (what it looks like), and the reference. We also learned tags.<br>
There are different types of tags; opening and closing tags. There are also void tags. When you have <br> an opening tag with content
and a closing tag, these items together are called an element.<p> If I wanted to make an item italicized, the tag <em> makes them <br>

</em>italicized, but once I insert the closing tag, everything after the closing tag goes back to regular type. <br>
  I also learned that I can make words <b>bold</b> by using the "b" tag.<pr> We also learned about attributes. That
    means <br> I can use an attribute name like href and insert a website. One example we learned in class <br>
    is <a> href = "www.reddit.com"> derp"</a>
  </pr> 
</p> We learned that we can insert an image by using the tag <img src ="url" abt = "text"> This is blind text because images <br> don't have 
a closing tag.' They are called Void tags. An Anchor tag uses href attributes while image tags use src attributes. <br>
<p> We also learned about inline and block tags.</p>
<p> We learned that a web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. <br> Web
  browserss read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language a computer can understand. The  computer <br> which is a dumb machine, can follow the instructions the programmer wrote 
That being said, programmers need to write <br> "exactly" the way a  computer understands. This is
    also known as writing with correct syntax. " </div> 
  <br>
<body><br><b> <div> Lesson 2 Summary </b> </br>

</body>I learned that everything on a page is a box. In one example we changed the shape of circles <br>
by simply changing the Style of the page. We also removed the check mark from the border raise <br>
  field and the circles became squares or boxes.</div> <br>
<body><br><b> <div> Lesson 3 Summary </b></br> </body>
This was the most confusing of all to me. We learned about the tree structure referred to
as <b> Document Object Model (DOM).</b><br>
We applied attributes to pieces of the document to now where the style goes. We basically
dissected a page with pictures and words <br> and determined that everything on a page is a block. <br> We learned in theory that concept related content must be within a container element <br> like "span" or "div." Related container elements have the same class name.
